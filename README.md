# Online-Voting-System
Online Voting System for Award Nominations


Here we included separate tabs for organizers, voters, and administrators. Organizers can log 
and organize an online voting event. Voters can register and they can give their vote through 
the system. We created category tab for various fields and from that, voters can give their 
vote from choosing the relevant field.


This project is done by our team as our First year Second year project
