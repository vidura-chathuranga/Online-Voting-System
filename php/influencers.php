            <p>Content creators are artists, storytellers and subject matter experts who have taken to platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and others which has given a fighting chance to talented people to succeed who otherwise would have never got the attention they deserved. Today these influencers are leveraging social media platforms to channel trends through their content as audiences trust them. As per multiple reports, the industry is slated to grow exponentially in the coming years. ETBrandEquity.com's Influencer Marketing Awards is an initiative to recognise the burgeoning tribe of these digital content creators who are responsible for shaping the future of digital media in India and honour the people who make this industry what it is.
